-A folder named “examples” with 5 representative selected test examples that can be used to run your tool; Each example must have a readme.txt file explaining the intention of the example and the expected results.

-A folder named “testsuite” with the examples you have used to test your tool and if possible with the makefiles and scripts used.

-In the case of Java tools: the jar file for your tool (note that your tool must be able to be executed using: java -jar <name of the jar file.jar> followed by the possible options and by the input/output files.

-In the case of command line tools, they must output usage info when executed without arguments.
Other files needed to test and evaluate your tool.
The file README.txt (see below the information you should include in this file);

Please, find below an indication of the content we expect in the README.txt file. Note that you need to include a brief description for each topic.
