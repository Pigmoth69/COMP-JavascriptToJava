We can also create a java switch with success since javascript and java have a similar switch!


Expected output:

public final class JS2Java {

}
    private static int x = 3;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        switch(x){
            case 6:
               text = "Today is Saturday";
               break;
            case 0:
               text = "Today is Sunday";
               x++;
               break;
            case 22:
               break;
            default:
               text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
    }
}
